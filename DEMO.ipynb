    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first practical of the Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics course delves into the realm of learning general-purpose sentence representations within the context of natural language inference (NLI). Our objective encompasses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementing four neural models to classify sentence pairs based on their relation.\n",
    "- Training these models utilizing the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus (Bowman et al., 2015).\n",
    "- Evaluating the trained models using the SentEval framework (Conneau and Kiela, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "NLI involves discerning entailment or contradiction relationships between premises and hypotheses, a fundamental aspect of understanding language. This assignment emphasizes pretraining a sentence encoder on NLI and subsequently evaluating its efficacy on diverse natural language tasks.\n",

    "The model appears to struggle with interpreting scenarios involving negation and the absence of an action or entity. For instance, in the first example, the premise \"Two men sitting in the sun\" doesn't necessarily imply that \"Nobody is sitting in the shade\". However, the model seems to interpret the presence of negation words like \"Nobody\" as indicating a contradiction. This might suggest that the model lacks a nuanced understanding of how negation interacts with different contexts to produce a neutral outcome rather than a contradiction.\n",

    "Similarly, the second example \"A man is walking a dog\" being related to \"No cat is outside\" presents a case where the absence mentioned in the hypothesis doesn't logically contradict the premise. The model's decision to predict a contradiction instead of a neutral response might indicate a lack of understanding of scenarios where the presence of one entity doesn't necessarily exclude the presence of another. This could be a limitation in the model’s training where it was not exposed to enough diverse examples that specifically teach this kind of logical separation.\n",

    "These failures can often stem from a model’s training data not adequately representing complex linguistic structures like negation or from an embedding layer that doesn't capture the necessary contextual cues to distinguish between unrelated statements effectively. The model may also be influenced by biases in the dataset, where the presence of certain keywords biases predictions towards contradiction.\n",

    "A) Experiment Uno (Understanding Negation in Different Contexts):\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and second tests, involving the premise \"The room was crowded,\" examine how the model handles negation when it either directly contradicts the premise or is contextually unrelated. Both hypotheses included negations (\"No one was in the room\" and \"No one was outside\"), but their relations to the premise differed. The model incorrectly favored entailment in both cases, indicating a failure to properly handle negation that either contradicts or is unrelated to the premise. This suggests that the model may struggle to assess the logical impact of negation within the given context, favoring entailment perhaps due to training biases or limitations in its learning of contextual nuances.\n",

    "B) Experiment Dos (Impact of Context on Negation Interpretation):\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and fourth tests using \"She was alone at home\" further explored this by presenting negations with different contextual relevances (\"Nobody was with her\" directly supports the premise, while \"Nobody was at the park\" is contextually irrelevant). The model's predictions revealed a tendency to overlook the contextual irrelevance, as it incorrectly predicted high probabilities for entailment where neutrality was expected. This indicates issues with the model's ability to differentiate when contextual changes around a negation should alter its interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these results, it's clear that the model does exhibit the hypothesized weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There appears to be a consistent bias toward predicting entailment when faced with negations, regardless of whether they contradict or are unrelated to the premise.\n",
    "- The model struggles with properly interpreting negation in different contexts, especially distinguishing between contradicting and unrelated scenarios."
