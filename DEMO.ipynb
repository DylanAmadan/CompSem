    "The model appears to struggle with interpreting scenarios involving negation and the absence of an action or entity. For instance, in the first example, the premise \"Two men sitting in the sun\" doesn't necessarily imply that \"Nobody is sitting in the shade\". However, the model seems to interpret the presence of negation words like \"Nobody\" as indicating a contradiction. This might suggest that the model lacks a nuanced understanding of how negation interacts with different contexts to produce a neutral outcome rather than a contradiction.\n",

    "Similarly, the second example \"A man is walking a dog\" being related to \"No cat is outside\" presents a case where the absence mentioned in the hypothesis doesn't logically contradict the premise. The model's decision to predict a contradiction instead of a neutral response might indicate a lack of understanding of scenarios where the presence of one entity doesn't necessarily exclude the presence of another. This could be a limitation in the model’s training where it was not exposed to enough diverse examples that specifically teach this kind of logical separation.\n",

    "These failures can often stem from a model’s training data not adequately representing complex linguistic structures like negation or from an embedding layer that doesn't capture the necessary contextual cues to distinguish between unrelated statements effectively.

The model incorrectly favored entailment in both cases, indicating a failure to properly handle negation that either contradicts or is unrelated to the premise.
